The goal of this project is to create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js that will allow users to interact with a MongoDB database.
The API will use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the data.
The project will require the installation of the following dependencies: mongoose, express, body-parser, and nodemon.
The API will be tested using tools such as Postman or cURL to ensure that the endpoints are functioning correctly.
The project will include validation and error handling to ensure that data entered into the database is valid and that errors are handled gracefully.
The project will follow best practices for RESTful API design, including using semantic URLs and HTTP status codes to provide clear responses to client requests.
The project will be structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate concerns and ensure that the code is modular and maintainable.
